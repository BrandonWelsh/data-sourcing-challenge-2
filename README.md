## Program Goals
"You've been tasked to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. You will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods." (copied from Bootcamp Spot Module 6 Challenge Instructions page)

## Resources Utilized
This section is dedicated to keep track of what I used to help complete this program.

60% Class Notes

30% AI assistance

10% NYT/TMDB API reference pages

This assignment took quite a bit of help from an AI to get it working, but I still largely referred to class notes and made changes to suit my needs.

## Bugs
I cannot get print(f"No more results on page {page}") to print in my try and except function in the NYT API retrieval.

You may have also noticed that my github repository is named "data-sourcing-challenge-2". Well, long story short I screwed something up real bad on the OG (related to the gitignore) and had to make a new one because gitbash was freaking the f*** out and I could not get it to shut the hell up and just do its job and I am too close to the deadline to mess with it over a simple repo name.

## Update Log
12/10/2023: Started work on assignment. Got github repo created and finished part 1: Access the New York Times API. Saved work to github.
