## IMPORTANT - READ
All my work for this assignment is located in the .ipynb_checkpoints folder. I don't know what that duplicate retrieve_movie_data.ipynb file is doing in this repo but ignore it, I never even touched it.

## Program Goals
"You've been tasked to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. You will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods." (shamelessly copied straight from Bootcamp Spot Module 6 Challenge Instructions page).

## Resources Utilized
This section is dedicated to keep track of what I used to help complete this program.

60% Class Notes

30% AI assistance

10% NYT/TMDB API reference pages (mostly for the query building part)

This assignment took quite a bit of help from an AI to get it working, but I still largely referred to class notes and simply copied my notes and made changes necessary to suit my needs. I also had to spend quite a bit of time scrolling through the API reference pages for each of the two websites while figuring out how to build the queries.

## Bugs
I cannot get print(f"No more results on page {page}") to print in my try/except function in the NYT API retrieval. It's probably something to do with indentation or loop logic and I just can't figure it out.

The output 'movies.csv' was successfully created at the end but it is unable to be pushed to github, likely due to the gitignore.

You may have also noticed that my github repository is named "data-sourcing-challenge-2". Well, long story short I screwed something up real bad on the OG (related to the gitignore) and had to make a new one because gitbash was freaking the f*** out on me and I could not get it to shut the hell up and just do its job and I am WAY too close to the deadline to mess with it over a simple repo name, so... data-sourcing-challenge-2 it is.

## Update Log
12/10/2023: Started work on assignment. Got github repo created and finished part 1: Access the New York Times API. Saved work to github.

12/10/2023: Finished part 2: Access The Movie Database API.

12/10/2023: Finished part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export. I may make more changes tomorrow but it's otherwise working.

12/11/2023: Just did some touchups and commenting to make sure it was all good and ready to submit.
